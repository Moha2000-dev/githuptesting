 Hotel Management System - Console App in C#

This is a basic **Hotel Management System** built in C#. The system allows hotel staff to manage room bookings,
view available and reserved rooms, search for guest information, and calculate total costs.
It is entirely **console-based** and uses arrays to store data.
